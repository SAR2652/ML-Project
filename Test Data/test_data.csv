two mixtures of a and b have a and b in the ratio 3 : 2 and 3 : 4 . in what proportion should these two mixtures be mixed to get a new mixture in which the ration of a to b is 5 : 4 ?,"i got c but with a different , yet slightly longer approach , which i constantly use for proportion problems such as this one . usually , this approach is very efficient when used with slightly difficult questions , but this problem is quite hard so i had to slightly tweak it . i will show you how i usually use the approach and later show you how to use it with this specific problem . example . 1 liter of solution a contains 45 % alcohol , while 1 liter of solution b contains 20 % alcohol . in what ratio must the two solutions be used to get a solution with 30 % alcohol solution : 1 . 45 / 100 * [ a / ( a + b ) ] + 20 / 100 * [ b / ( a + b ) ] = 30 / 100 2 . multiply 100 to both sides to arrive at 45 a / ( a + b ) + 20 b / ( a + b ) = 30 3 . multiply ( a + b ) to both sides to arrive at 45 a + 20 b = 30 a + 30 b 4 . distribute to arrive at 15 a = 10 b 5 . thus the ratio is a / b = 10 / 15 = 2 / 3 now using this same approach , we tackle gopu 106 ’ s question . it is important to first think of x in the mixture as the alcohol in the problem above ; hence , a mixture of x and y in the ratio of 3 : 2 translates to x is 3 / 5 of the solution . applying this concept to all three equations , we write : 1 . 3 / 5 * [ a / ( a + b ) ] + 3 / 7 * [ b / ( a + b ) ] = 5 / 9 2 . now here is the tweak that must be made to continue with this approach . you must find the common denominator for all three numbers and organize the fractions accordingly . by finding the common denominator of 5 , 79 ( or 315 ) we re - write the equations as follows 3 . 189 / 315 * [ a / ( a + b ) ] + 135 / 315 * [ b / ( a + b ) ] = 175 / 315 4 . multiply 315 to both sides to arrive at 189 a / ( a + b ) + 135 b / ( a + b ) = 175 5 . multiply ( a + b ) to both sides to arrive at 189 a + 135 b = 175 a + 175 b 6 . distribute to arrive at 14 a = 40 b 7 . thus the ratio is a / b = 40 / 14 = 20 / 7 or answer c"
